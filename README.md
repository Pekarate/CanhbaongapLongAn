 + Monitoring water parameters such as salinity, pH levels, temperature, and water level.<br />
 + Measuring additional metrics like wind direction and wind speed.<br />
 + Collecting data through sensors connected via an RS485 port using the Modbus protocol.<br />
 + Capturing images with a Hikvision camera connected through an Ethernet port.<br />
 + Sending collected data to a server via a 4G module.<br />
 + Entering a deep sleep mode after data transmission to conserve energy.<br />
